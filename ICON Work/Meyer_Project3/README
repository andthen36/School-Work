The program should just run by copying and pasting it into the assembly.

It begins at x3000 and immeditaly ask user to enter a string of numbers.

LOOP_COUNT: everytime the user hits a number it will run through this loop and be checked by IS_INT to make sure if it is a decimal, if not it will pull a error, if it is then it would be sent to DtoA.

All even numbers are devided and put into R3, the odds are put in R4.

DtoA is converting the decimal to ASCII for when they are printed out

Print just prints aout the end resualts of whats been counted.

PROBLEMS: MY code has some issues, manly that the error handler is not working correctly when a letter is put in instead of a decimal.
